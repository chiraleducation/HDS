# Health Data Science 

## What is Health Data Science? 
Health Data Science is a discipline that combines maths, statistics and technology to study different types of health problems using data. It provides the tools to manage and analyse very large amounts of different datasets across our healthcare systems. 

## Why is health data research important?
Using health data for research helps us to better understand diseases and conditions – their causes, prevalence and symptoms – and it can provide new ways of treating them or spotting them earlier. There are lots of examples of how health data science has improved our knowledge of health and care and has helped solve challenging health problems.

## What type of data is used in research?
- **Patient data** from the NHS and social care, including hospital and primary care administration data (e.g. dates and times of appointments) through to information about treatment, medical and diagnostic tests.
- **Studies about the health of groups of people**, which may be based on a particular health condition (e.g. cancer), or issues which affect the health of people (e.g. smoking).
- **Data from blood or tissue samples** which can be used to derive genetic information
- **Data from images, which include x-rays, MRI, CT images** that contain a huge amount of information
- **Health and fitness devices**, which provide data on things like heart rate, activity and calories
